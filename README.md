**[Roland - TR-08](https://www.roland.com/global/products/tr-08)**

THE LEGENDARY BOOM AND SIZZLE OF THE MOST FAMOUS DRUM MACHINE EVER MADE—NOW IN AN AFFORDABLE AND MODERN FORMAT

*The TR-08 is an obsessively detailed and faithful replica of the legendary TR-808—easily the most famous and influential drum machine ever made. After creating a monumental shift in the sound of music, the “808” has continued to shape and define entire genres. Beloved by musicians and producers the world over, it’s one of the most revered and sought-after electronic musical instruments of all time. The TR-08 brings the look, sound, and feel of the original 808—with stunning accuracy—to the Roland Boutique format. It blends attention to detail and respect for legacy with modern convenience and reliability.*

### Classic Synth

**[Roland - SH-01A](https://www.roland.com/global/products/sh-01a/)**

FOUR TIMES THE SOUNDS IN A FRACTION OF THE SIZE

*The SH-01A is a meticulous reproduction of the iconic Roland SH-101, one of the most popular classic synthesizers of all time. Our Analog Circuit Behavior (ACB) technology reproduces the SH-101’s legendary sounds by faithfully recreating the actual behavior of the original analog circuits, right down to the fine details and odd quirks that have endeared the synth to musicians and producers for decades. The SH-01A builds on the great sounds and creative immediacy of the original, now in the popular Roland Boutique format—offering exciting new polyphonic capabilities, inspiring new performance features, and a level of authenticity that could only come from Roland.*


### Bass line

**[Roland - TB-03](https://www.roland.com/global/products/tb-03/)**

THE CLASSIC TB-303 SOUND IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND

*The battery-powered TB-03 is a direct descendant of the famous TB-303 Bass Line Synth. The layout and controls are unchanged, so it works just like the original. It sounds like it too, thanks to Roland’s advanced ACB technology that recreates the hypnotic liquid grooves of the magic silver box. But the new TB-03 goes even further, with several enhancements not found on the original model. The four-digit LED display makes programming easier and more accurate, while overdrive and delay effects let you unleash a twisted, tribal wall of sound to send the crowd into a frenzy. Back in the studio, the TB-03 can send control information via MIDI or its USB port, the latter of which also functions as a audio interface.*


### Modular Synth

**[Moog - Mother 32](https://www.moogmusic.com/products/mother-32)**

*Mother-32® is an intuitive and expandable semi-modular synthesizer that adds raw analog sound, powerful sequencing and extensive interconnectivity to any creative, electronic or modular ecosystem.*
